## README

This is a CKAN plugin that exists only for demonstration purposes. It provides a simple 
example of how to hook into the queued (celery task) processing of uploaded resources.

The ckanext-archiver and ckanext-datastorer plugins are using this same pattern to archive, 
analyze and store user-supplied resources.
